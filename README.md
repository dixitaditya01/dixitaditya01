### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a software engineer at a fast-moving startup, where I work at the intersection of AI and backend systems. Over the past couple of years, I've designed AI-driven components, built tools for intelligent data extraction, and developed core product features with a strong focus on clean architecture and real-world impact. 

I enjoy solving problems end-to-end — from research and prototyping to deployment and optimization. Currently Working on creating some fun and unique AI Projects.
